**Abstract:**   
One of the unique characteristics of cellular signaling pathways is that a
common signaling pathway can selectively regulate multiple cellular functions
of a hormone; however, this selective downstream control through a common
signaling pathway is poorly understood. Here we show that the insulin-
dependent AKT pathway uses temporal patterns multiplexing for selective
regulation of downstream molecules. Pulse and sustained insulin stimulations
were simultaneously encoded into transient and sustained AKT phosphorylation,
respectively. The downstream molecules, including ribosomal protein S6 kinase
(S6K), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β)
selectively decoded transient, sustained, and both transient and sustained AKT
phosphorylation, respectively. Selective downstream decoding is mediated by
the molecules' network structures and kinetics. Our results demonstrate that
the AKT pathway can multiplex distinct patterns of blood insulin, such as
pulse-like additional and sustained-like basal secretions, and the downstream
molecules selectively decode secretion patterns of insulin.
